Updating the scrolling area character set for the smooth scroll. No need to counter rotate the score panel characters.

Radar characters.

Sprites behind the characters.

Very unrolled speed code, no index register, very quick but uses a lot of memory.
	But the game only scrolls in 4 directions so it's OK.
