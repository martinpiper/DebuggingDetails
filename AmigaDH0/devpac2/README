Devpac Amiga 2		Release 2.14
==============		============

Although individual program version numbers may vary, the
version number that should be written on your registration
card should be 2.14. When requiring technical support or
reporting bugs, please be sure to also quote the version
number of the individual program in question.

Lattice C users should read the LatticeInfo file on this disk.
The ARP library has been updated since version 2.13.

We have added many new features to Devpac Amiga since version
2.08, detailed below:

Editor
======
Shift-Amiga-A assembles without the options requestor.

Shift-Amiga-L loads a file without the ARP requestor for the
benefit of slow hard-disk users.

Assembler
=========
Various bugs have been fixed, including multi-line macro
calls, quoted section names and BSS sections. In addition
it is now possible to pass quoted filenames to GenIm2.

Expressions of the form lab1-lab2 are now allowed when lab1
and lab2 are both in another section (which must be the same
section).

When using Word- or Long-sized indirection, addresses are checked
to be even, for example MOVE.L 5,A6 will give an error. This may be
disabled if required (e.g. 68020 users) using OPT E-

The register list syntax produced in MOVEM lists from MonAm
is now accepted by GenAm.

The | character is now accepted as a bitwise OR operator (for
all you C programmers!)

Symbols set using REG may now be used in expressions, with a
warning. Their value is the same as that used in the MOVEM op.

If generating executable, absolute code you may specify ORG.W
which will force all program references to be short-word.

The RORG directive is now supported for compatibility.

There are several new optimisations that the assembler can
perform, using OPT O. Additional types are:
	3	Short Word Addressing
References to absolute addresses in the range 0-7FFF and
FFFF8000 to FFFFFFFF will be optimised.
	4	MOVEQ optimising
Statements of the form MOVE.L <expr>,Dn will be optimised
to MOVEQ if <expr> is -128 to 127 inclusive.
	5	Quick Optimising
Statements of the form ADD # and SUB # will be optimised
to ADDQ / SUBQ if possible.
	6	Warning of short branches
Not strictly an optimisation, OPT OW6+ in combination with
OP O1+ will give warnings on forward branches that can be
made short so you may optimise them yourself.
The warning messages produced by each optimisation may be
individually controlled, using OPT OWx+ / OPT OWx- where
'x' is the optimising number (shown above), e.g. OPT OW3+

There is a new option which can be used to detect typing
errors, OPT i. With this on, any indirect, absolute reference
(other than location 4) will give the error '# probably
missing'. For example, the line
	and.b $df,d1
will give an error as and.b #$df,d1 is really intended. This
can be overidden on a line-by-line basis (e.g. for hardware
register access) by specifying the expression within brackets
and using .W or .L, for example move.l (_ciabase).L,d0

When using the stand-alone version of the assembler it is
possible to define labels on the command-line using the
-e option, which should be followed by one or more
assignments, separated by commas or spaces. Such
definitions are parsed as if they were the second line in
the source (i.e. after any options). For example,
	genim2 test -l -e TYPE=4,OUTPUT=1

The '@' character is now allowed in symbols, except when
followed by a digit from 0-7 when it is taken as the start
of an octal number. This is for Lattice C 5.0 users.

Shell 1.3 Users: GenIm2 may be made resident. GenAm2/MonAm2
must not be made resident as they are not re-entrant.

Debugger
========
Various bugs have been fixed, including disassembling certain
BTST instructions, the register window display, 68020/030
compatibility, Ctrl-T on a breakpoint, symbol character
significance, and cross-referencing.

All memory is now checked before it is read to ensure it exists.
Previously any reads of hardware registers (@C00000) or accidental
reads because of wrap-around could cause nasty crashes. Invalid memory 
is displayed as **

The Alt-O command can be repeated by pressing space after it shows 
the numbers.

The default printer is now nothing, previously it was PRT:

68020/030 Users: please note the instruction cache is turned
off while MonAm is loaded to prevent nasty interactions with
the debugger. The cache is restored to its original state when
the debugger terminates. Disabling the cache will produce a
performance degradation for which we can only apologise. Please
also note that the Tutorial in section 1.11 is not valid for
these processors because they allow the odd-access that is used
in the example.

Disk Details
============

In order to make space on Disk 1, the following files and
directories have been deleted:
	Utilities	all
	Fonts		all except Topaz
	System		some
You can find these files on your original Workbench disk that
came with your machine.

When using GenAm2 and MonAm2 on PAL machines with external RAM,
you may sometimes get *two* mouse pointers; one will be the
normal Intuition pointer, the other will be the custom pointer
associated with the program you are using. Do not be alarmed -
this seems to be a harmless bug in Intuition.

The gb keymap has been updated so that the Help key works on A500s.
