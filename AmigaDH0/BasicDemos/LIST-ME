'            HOW TO RUN Amiga BASIC DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS
'            =============================================
' 
' 
' For special instructions on how to deal with a 256k Amiga see the 
' end of this document.
' 
'         1a. If you have 2 disk drives insert the Workbench diskette
'                in the internal drive and the Extras diskette in the
'                external drive.  Boot the system (<Ctrl><Amiga><Amiga>).
'         1b. If you have a 1 drive system insert the Workbench 
'                diskette and boot the system  (<Ctrl><Amiga><Amiga>).
'         2. Open the Extras diskette, then the BasicDemos Drawer.
'         3. Select and open the demo of your choice.  The information
'                below will then be useful.
' 
' DEMO   How to interact with:
' ======= =============================================================
' SPEECH -- On a 1 drive system Basic will ask for the Workbench 
'        diskette in order to access the Translator and Narrator
'        devices.  Once loaded The demo will display and speak 
'        instructions.
'        
'        There are 6 "slider" devices that control Pitch, Inflection,
'        Rate, Voice, Tune, and Volume.  To the left side is "low",
'        to the right is "high".  Note that Voice has only 2 positions,
'        male and female.  See the manual (SAY command) for additional
'        information.
' 
'        To exit select the close gadget in the upper left hand corner.
' 
'
' MUSIC -- Displays a screen with lines in it as it plays a tune.  If
'        you resize the window the lines will soon start to follow the 
'        new boarders.  (You may see a little leftover line from time
'        to time.)
' 
'        To exit select the close gadget in the upper left hand corner.
' 
'
' LIBRARY -- This demo prints some sample text in different type styles.
'        To do this it uses calls to DOS and Graphics libraries.
' 
'        To exit select the close gadget in the upper left hand corner
'        or type "system".
' 
'
' SCREEN -- This demo requires 512k (or more).  If you do not have 512k you
'        can exit by typing "system<RETURN>".
'        
'        To exit select the close gadget in the upper left hand corner
'        or type "system<RETURN>".
' 
'
' DEMO -- With 256k this demo is decidedly less interesting (than with
'        512k) but still runs.  The 256k version just puts up one 
'        window and bounces some small balls around.  If 512k is 
'        available the demo puts up 4 windows and does something
'        different in each.
' 
'        To exit this demo choose "Stop" from the run menu, then "Quit
'        from the project menu.
' 
'
' PICTURE -- This demo is described in detail in the tutorial portion of
'        the manual.  It creates a "sphere" in the upper left hand part
'        of the screen, then will move it to where ever you click the
'        mouse.  You can also drag the mouse and move it that way.
' 
'        To exit select the close gadget in the upper left hand corner.
' 
'
' PICTURE2 -- This demo is identical to Picture1 and provided as a backup
'        of Picture.  See the tutorial section in the manual for 
'        additional information.
' 
'
' OBJEDIT -- This is an OBJect EDITor.  You can edit objects (BOBs and 
'        sprites) for later use in your own animation.  This program
'        is also documented in the manual.  On a 256k system the
'        "paint" option is not supported.  This is because paint
'        can take a lot of memory to execute.
' 
'        To exit this program use the second mouse (menu) button
'        and choose Project-Quit.
'
' 
' TERMINAL -- On a 1 drive system Basic will ask for the Workbench 
'        diskette in order to access the Serial Device driver. This 
'        "demo" will communicate with a terminal at 9600 baud.  It
'        is a very simple program, try listing it.
' 
'        To exit select the close gadget in the upper left hand corner.
' 
'
' SCREENPRINT -- This program draws random string designs and allows
'        The user to dump the screen to a supported graphic printer. 
'        
'        To exit press "Q" (Quit). You can not quit during a graphic dump.
'
'
' BITPLANES -- This demo finds the addresses of the BitPlanes (screen ram)
'              of its screen.  It calculates and prints the addresses
'              of screen related structures, and variables from those
'              structures (such as the RGB color table values).
'
'        To exit, click the left mouse button.
' 
'
' CONVERTFD -- This "demo" is used to translate name.FD files into 
'        name.bmap files so that Amiga BASIC can access libraries
'        of machine language routines by name, via the LIBRARY
'        statement.  The 1.2 Amiga fd files are in the Extras:fd1.2
'        directory.  Do not call system library routines without
'        understanding the setup required and the results of the
'        routines.  There are technical books available which
'        explain the use of the system library routines.
'
'        To exit this demo choose "Stop" from the run menu, then "Quit
'        from the project menu.
' 
'
' GRAPHICS.BMAP --
' EXEC.BMAP --
' DOS.BMAP --
' BALL -- These 4 data files are used by other demo programs.  They
'        are not demos in and of themselves.
'
'
' IFF DEMOS --
'
' Note:  These demos all require the .bmap files in the BasicDemos
'        directory.  BasicDemos must be the current directory when
'        these programs are run.  If you start a program by double
'        clicking its icon, its drawer automatically becomes the
'        current directory.  But if you LOAD these programs from
'        within AmigaBasic, you must set the current directory
'        yourself.  Do this with the CHDIR command.
'        ( Example:  chdir "Extras:BasicDemos" ) 
'         
'
'    LOADILBM-SAVEACBM --- This demo loads the IFF ILBM picture file
'        called "Heart.ILBM" and demos color cycling.  It also gives
'        you the option of saving the ILBM file in ACBM format
'        for faster loading by AmigaBasic (with LOADACBM).
'        A Graphicraft pic such as Heart.ILBM will not load much
'        faster as an ACBM but a compacted (DPaint, Aegis) pic
'        can be loaded much more quickly as an ACBM.
'        
'    LOADACBM --- Loads an ACBM pic file such as those created with
'        the above program. 
'
'    SAVEILBM --- Draws a demo screen and saves it as an IFF ILBM file.
'        The ILBM file can be loaded into IFF graphics packages such
'        as Graphicraft, Deluxe Paint, and Aegis Images.     
'    
'    HEART.ILBM --- A Graphicraft IFF ILBM picture file which is 
'        loaded by the LOADILBM-SAVEACBM demo.
'

' Special Instructions for People with 256k Systems:
' --------------------------------------------------
' 
' If you are using a 256k Amiga memory will be very tight for some of
' these demos, this makes the following steps necessary:
' 
'         1. Power off your Amiga.
'         2. Remove any external disk drives (floppy and hard disks).
'                Buffers are allocated when the the Amiga notices that
'                these drives are present.  This can allocate a 
'                significant amount of memory.
'         3. Power on your Amiga and boot using KickStart and Workbench.
'         4. When the Workbench icon appears and the drive light goes 
'                out eject the Workbench diskette.
'         5. Insert the Extras diskette and open (double click) its icon.
'         6. Open the BasicDemos drawer.
'         7. Close the Extras window.  Closing windows frees memory.
'         8. Drag the demo of interest outside the BasicDemos window.
'         9. Close the BasicDemos window.  Closing windows frees memory.
'        10. Open (double click) the demo Icon you have moved.
