'BMAPS  ---  C. Scheppner   CBM  02/88
'
'  AmigaBasic requires .bmap files
'to call system library functions
'from within an AmigaBasic program.
'
'  The BasicDemos directory contains 
'exec, dos, and graphics .bmap files
'which are required by some of the
'demos in that drawer.  
'
'   The .bmaps were created from
'some of the FD (function description)
'files in the FD drawer on this disk.
'Bmaps for other system libraries can
'be created with the ConvertFD program
'in the BasicDemos drawer.
'
'  The names of FD files are
'     libraryname_lib.fd
'  The names of bmaps must be
'     libraryname.bmap
'
'  So, to create additional .bmap
'files, run the ConvertFD program.
'For example, to create a layers.bmap:
'
'When prompted for name of fd file,
'enter    :FD1.3/layers_lib.fd
'When prompted for bmap filename
'enter    layers.bmap
'
'
'PLACEMENT OF BMAPS
'
'  When you use the LIBRARY statement,
'AmigaBasic looks for a .bmap file
'for that library.  It will look in two
'places for the .bmap:
'
'   1. The libs: directory
'      (Usually the libs directory of the
'      workbench disk you booted with.)
'
'   2. The directory AmigaBasic is
'      cd'd to.
'      When you enter AmigaBasic, this is
'      the directory (drawer) containing
'      the icon you double clicked.
'      You can cd to a different directory
'      with the CHDIR command.
'
'   To run the demos the use bmaps in
'in the BasicDemos drawer,
'EITHER doubleclick the demo's icon
'OR   - doubleclick AmigaBasic
'     - type  CHDIR "df1:BasicDemos" <RETURN>
'         in the Output window
'     - Open the desired demo
'     - Start the demo
'
'
'CONFLICTING ROUTINES / KEYWORDS
'
'  ConvertFD prepends an 'x' to
'any Amiga system routine name that
'conflicts with an AmigaBasic keyword.
'
'  The known conficting routine
'names can be found in data statements
'at the end of ConvertFD.
'
'  Using these .bmaps, the conflicting
'system routines may be declared
'and called by prepending an 'x' to
'the routine name. (ex. xRead)
'All other system routines are
'declared/called by their original
'names.
