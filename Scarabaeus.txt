Map display screen at $800 and chars at $3000

Game 3D display and score panel screens at $5000 $5400, charsets at $4000 $4800
Two charsets!
The multicolour charset data for the score panel seems to be swapped, depending on the screen 3D draw state?
The dynamic charset data for the 3D view isn't copied in when rotating the view, filling the charset with the same data shows it isn't being restored from elsewhere...

The charset at $4000 seems to be used for axis aligned movement and display.
The charset at $4800 seems to be used for rotation between the axis aligned display.
	Verified by filling the entire charsets


Possible to cheat on the first level by inserting "ghost" chars into the map display at $800

More map copies at $c800 and $f000?
	$c800 "e" is used for empty space and reversed "@" is solid.


The 3D draw *axis aligned* basically draws the left hand columns, to the middle, then the right hand columns, to the middle using a lookup table at $e8df
