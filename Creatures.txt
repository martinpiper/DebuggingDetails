3.14.6. DMA delay
"
The most sophisticated Bad Line manipulation is to create a Bad Line
Condition within cycles 15-53 of a raster line in the display window in
which the graphics data sequencer is in idle state, e.g. by modifying
register $d011 so that YSCROLL is equal to the lower three bits of RASTER.

But as
the accesses started in the middle of a line, less than 40 accesses took
place so VC has been incremented by a total of less than 40 in this raster
line and no longer is a multiple of 40 as it normally always is at the end
of a raster line. Because of the working of VC (see section 3.7.2.), this
"misalignment" is continued for all following lines. So the whole screen
seems to be scrolled to the right by as much characters as the number of
cycles the $d011 access was done after cycle 14.
