2d2 has some suspicious looking timer related setup code.

1f9 uses rti return to... 6389 same as Ocean release

hit and ocean have small differences, just some in the screen and the very top of memory, which might be due to decompression by the hit release compared to ocean that doesn't load the last $100 bytes of memory.
	Ocean tape $400 screen does show short "list" command and the start of a directory listing...
	The same can be seen by loading the directory from the D64 from archive, clear screen, then L<shift I><return>


sir release has large differences in the code/data in the middle of memory compared to ocean/hit.
	ocean 6ac6 (6ad9) shows some some missing bytes in the sir release...
	binary compare shows some code changes, resulting in offset differences but mostly the same opcodes.
sir and crew release are basically identical


D64 archive version from:
https://archive.org/details/d64_Wizball_1987_Ocean
Also saving at 6389 and comparing to Ocean
	Huge chunks of code at 8746
	Also text about "horizon" missing at b70b (this seems to be unused duplicate in the ocean release!)
	NTSC version due to border status panel
	

Roughly three code revisions
1. ocean/hit
2. sir/crew
3. D64 archive

sir release is identical to ocean PAL disk, except the very end of memory, which is blank in sir, and default "blank".
archive disk release is identical to the ocean NTSC disk release.


PAL tape to PAL disk changes are some code offsets
Tape: 415e	20 38 75
sdiff 6ac6 shows some removals at 6ad9 including opcodes ad = lda abs	d0 = bne
6ac8 = 20 = jsr
d 6ec6

tape has at 6ed7 lda $b872 bne $6ec3
disk does not have the code
m b800 shows inter-level bonus screen text, perhaps level or colour complete...

bk 6ed7 triggers on game quit, but not losing a life.
w store b872
9e29 lda $ef01
sta $b872
ms ef00 shows the pot graphic, probably the last pot8

Default is that b872 is 0
w load b872
then put breakpoints on all the opposite conditions (!= 0)

collecting all red colours on level one, triggers the breakpoint with b872 = aa
> ef01 aa triggers level colour complete
	but the bonus stage doesn't end
