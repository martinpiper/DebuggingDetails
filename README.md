# DebuggingDetails
 Debugging details for various projects

 Take note of any acme include paths with the --lib command line option, or relative paths used in !source and !bin directives.
 
 Most libraries, tools, and assembler, are available in the C64Pbulic repo: https://github.com/martinpiper/C64Public
 Be sure to repo is in the C64 folder, so that this DebuggingDetails and C64 folder are at the same working directory level, for example I use C:\work\C64 and C:\work\DebuggingDetails
