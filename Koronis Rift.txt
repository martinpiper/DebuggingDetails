8ad draw loop?
c8fa draw columns, unrolled for a specific column, draw from the bottom up, with X register
Clever use of self modifiying code to replace the unrolled sta aaaa,x with rts
jsr at $c902 is self modified
So actually it draws column spans using the self modified unrolled code, with X
$c92b also jsr is self modified


.C:08ad  20 69 C8    JSR $C869	Draws solid columns using self modified unrolled code
.C:08b0  20 67 96    JSR $9667	Draws landscape dots really
.C:08b3  20 CD 4E    JSR $4ECD		
.C:08b6  20 E1 08    JSR $08E1
.C:08b9  20 EF 08    JSR $08EF	Draws sprites
.C:08bc  20 B8 3C    JSR $3CB8
.C:08bf  20 F4 18    JSR $18F4

The easiest way is to clip is to change the sprite definition to point to an empty frame
