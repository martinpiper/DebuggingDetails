Two bit transfer protocol
c:0584

Seems to have a nice decrypt table lookup at c:05ad, for the table at c:0600 - c:06ff
Values only appear once in the table. e.g. h 600 700 36

Bitmap at $e000

Finding animated bitmap draw.
When only particle effects are being rendered...
w store e000 ff00
$37aa shows the bitmap draw for particles is using the eor method...



Multiplexor sprite MSBX update $2492
Seems to be general purpose, updates any sprite index 0-7
Seems to be using a raster IRQ to handle this



Stuck! But the screen at $0400 can be edited to remove collision issues
