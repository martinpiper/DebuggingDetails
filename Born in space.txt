	Nothing

The main scroll is using a line crunch and HSP/DMA delay
Sprite 7 is using X position updates during the sprite stars display
The boss is using bitmap, with some sprite overlays


Watching the memory view showed linear reads in this area d500...
f d500 d800 02
Seems to stop player movement and just fire a large weapon?
8fcf seems to be the routine to read this area of memory
8fce seems to be a count
$02e1 seems to be the joystick bits?

(C:$8fde) a 8fcf
.8fcf  lda #$35
.8fd1  sta $01
.8fd3  lda dc00
.8fd6  sta 2e1
.8fd9
(C:$8fd9) f 8fd9 8feb ea


h 0 ffff ad e1 02


8f9a might be a better joystick read place
8ff0 joystick processing

This seems better, it reads the joystick and avoids the recorded joystick and jumps straight to the joystick processing

$02c2 = lives

05:50 Using C64DebugGUI to check the display
08:00 Title screen - Uses sprites
08:24 Intermission - Bitmap screen
08:45 Game uses HSP/DMA Delay/line crunch
12:50 Boss uses bitmap screen and sprite stars
13:12 Sprite stars use X position updates
16:50 Intermission screen also loads data
17:35 Using ICU64 debugger
18:00 Making this playable, instead of self playing
35:30 Player lives cheat
