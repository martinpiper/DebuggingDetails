Level data at $8a00
Seems to be 8a00 bit field for walls in one axis
Seems to be 8b00 bit field for walls in other axis
8b8b walls around the exit first level
Stride seems to be 4 bytes with a bit field, maybe 4x8 bits width/height? So a 32x32 map of bitss?
$8b83 seems to be the walls north/south of the player start
$8b7f north/south walls to the left of the start position
$8b87 north/south walls to the right of the start position

$470d accesses 8b00,y
It isn't doing an incremental render here, the whole charset gets updated somewhere else
$6ac5 seems to be copying from the top half of the charset to the lower half?
$4edd each segment top wall, left to right? Called from $50e9
$62cb lots of jsrs for a draw?
	$4fbc draws the top edges...
	$6a65 draws the rest, fills etc
		$6ab9 
	
	$4d26 draws random dots?

So yes, after drawing the top edges and filling the top hald, it seems to mirror for the bottom half
Cool :)
