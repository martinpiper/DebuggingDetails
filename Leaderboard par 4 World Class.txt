chain rng
bpeek 31 1
$c554 start address
Same as on disk and in memory



Dynamic sprites, decompressed from roughly $7400


$2941 seems to be the start of the tee view draw?

$20aa $20ad $20b0 very similar enry points into reused code, just uses bit to hop over ldx #$xx

The top view seems to refuse quite a lot of the draw lines and fill code from the tee view.


$c554 number of green areas
$c555 number of yellow areas (bunkers)
water?
$c55c number of trees



When reading $c554 number of green areas
$20c7 reads 4 values, from $c59d and stores them into $21a5-$21a8
Then again reads four values from $c5a1 = 4 bytes different
Then $c5bd $c5dd

Piece coordinates
$c59d+2 seems to be x pos of the first piece (tee)
$c5a1+2 ditto but second piece
lo/hi x pos
lo/hi y pos
