9dfe calls the player calculate to buffer routine for three players
84d5 is each player draw calc with X = 0,1,2

3 6 9 c f are left right up down fire input bits for each of the players

84df reads a state machine routine address...

8a17 always stores 0 when no inputs pressed?



8a18 can be modified to update the frame displayed when stationary!
