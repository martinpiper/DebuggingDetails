Add filename prefixes to recovered files

file17_3.prg isn't is the directory
Might be scrambled XOR?
Not scrambled, can see sprites at $4000 and charsets


Compare
C:\Temp\d64recover\thecode_file19_0.prg
C:\Temp\d64recover\file17_3.prg

thecode_file19_0 contains more data, but the start is identical to file17_3
First differences at file offset $c572
file17_3 has a file chain error towards the end
thecode_file19_0 seems to use different blocks
Perhaps file17_3 is an old file that was partially deleted.

Looks like a simple protection check, followed by two bit transfer protocol at c:$17d
8:$6df execute job code
Real drive code execute 8:$600
c:$1bf rts of receive drive byte

c:$15f end of load
Just displays loading screen for a few seconds... Then blanks screen again to load the game data.

$4240 looks like the game start code



Tape version
c:\work\c64\bin\TapeTool.exe r "E:\Ultimate tape archive\Ultimate_Tape_Archive_V3.0\Ultimate_Tape_Archive_V3.0\Operation_Wolf_(1988_Ocean_Software_Ltd)_[2588]\Operation_Wolf.tap" bc10000

Will probably attempt to auto-start BASIC line input/decode vector $0302 code at $02a7
$3e0 code wins
$351 tape pulse decode

Eventually runs some code at $100 which does the final load higher up in memory and lower in memory, especially the screen and start of BASIC.
and then does jmp $4240 same as disk


Disk and tape practically identical.
