Bug!

c:e2 = sta ()

At c:35f set Y=ff

load "*",8,1
without the trailing : colon
And using 1541, not 1541-ii

Budget release no title screen and music with scrolling message...


Title screen uses sprite overlay for the dissolve...
The sprite dissolve with horizontal bands using the sprite pointer updates as the sprite is drawn...
The screen split is covered with X expanded multicolour sprites
The large characters are a mixture of hires and multicolour sprites, with X and/or Y expansion, wow, quite a complex multiplexor
Sample playback code at $a1 stores to $d418 (volume) at c8 e8 seems to just use the top nybble?
Ah ha, there are two sample routines copied over, which select the different nybbles by code at $3525 and $3538
Large background around $a800 and charset at $c000
