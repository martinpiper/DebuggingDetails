looks like $17 $16 and $18 are decoded joystick directions and fire flag?
$ad19 seems to be the real entry...

w 16 18
>> Triggers inside $dcd code
used as a random number source? for joystick movement? into 16 17 18?
This routine also stores into $ed and $ee
>> $df9 also

Looking for the level select logic...
$af9 seems to run the logic?
is it the 1077 random read that sets the next level?

104f inc the $ae choice?
107e = start? nope
109a = inc another choice?

$133d = return to game start?
nope not there, the menu just changed
