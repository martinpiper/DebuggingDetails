Data duplication on track 36 - 41


NTSC Disk
Trilogic V3.2 SYS 2075
But doesn't seem to work? CPU JAM


PAL Disk
Also Trilogic V3.2
38911 text at roughly $a18, indicates compressed BASIC start screen?
Also what looks like monitor text at $c00 "nv-bdizc"? And "ready" message just before...

$4f jmp $409b
Here the decompressed monitor screen is visible showing "g 4800"
Ahh the 38911 was in the zeropage, probably the last displayed number

$1ef rti probably starts the game...

Lucky sequence of undefined opcodes resulting in game start: https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=70136
