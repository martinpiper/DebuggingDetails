Disk version
$6da looks like the start of the descrmable with X as EOR code
$6cf looks like PLA for EOR descramble using $c6

$900 looks like the game start?
bank ram
bk 900
s "c:\temp\tdisk900.prg" 0 200 ffff



disk score save code $1246 using kernal
Earier code at $1216
al 12f9 .setupDiskMDash

Sends disk code at $3202

dev 8:
break 300 800
disk code at $500
score table write using job codes at $04 track 2 sector 1

dev 8:
w store 0 5
w store 6 more efficient, less ROM updates to the job codes
break 373 seems to be the last sector in the chain code...

Main file starts loading at track $11 sector $01 ?
No, it's short, two sectors.

^^ Main game? Scrambled
WinHex->Edit->Modify Data
	XOR C6
Update first two bytes back to FC 08 (or select the block)

chainwrite c:\temp\morpheus_4.prg $02 $01






Tape version
c:\work\c64\bin\TapeTool.exe r "E:\Ultimate tape archive\Ultimate_Tape_Archive_V3.0\Ultimate_Tape_Archive_V3.0\Morpheus_(1988_Rainbird)_[7327]\Morpheus.tap" bc10000
start $2a7

IRQ at $351 wins the IRQ/NMI timer setup war

Quite a nice obfuscated tape loader which eventually stores bytes at $3a6
Calculated checksum at $c1 and read from tape checksum at $c2
Checksum check at $2d7
Quite a lot of self modifying state code in there

$3e5 tests the loading flag from $02

After loading code and bitmap at $e000 start $2a7 again
Which then stops CIA1 IRQs and jumps to self modified $e000


$e000 displays the loading bitmap and the animation
Interesting, it seems to reuse the loading code at $3a6

Seems to start game code at $900...





Game - Tape

Money likely at:
	$26 $27
	$272
	$c063

$272 looks like BCD
> 271 99
	Gives 990,000 G




Quite a lot of code changes between disk and tape.
