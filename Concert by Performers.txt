"@saganandroid4175 Hi Martin- saw a demo called "Concert by Performers, Commodore 64 demo, 2016" and thought of you at 2:42 into it.  They have 2 minutes of effects that could do with some explanation."

Remove colour RAM scroll

Remove Y pixel scroll

Colour RAM scroll with Y pixel scroll
Char screens + charsets counter rotate the Y pixel scroll
Expanded sprites for other text


The blocky nature of the sprites, with expansion and the horizontal colour bands, helps to confuse the eye with the colour RAM scroll text/graphics.
The shape/swirl animations are decompressed hidden with a static transition screen.

Switching off the various effects helps to show the different parts. :)
