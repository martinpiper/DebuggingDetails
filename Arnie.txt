Tape header empty. Will probably attempt to auto-start (as restored IRQ vector $0314 from $029f) loaded code at $02a8
Turbo loader at $3b3 uses some kernal ROM routines $fcdb $fcd1 for updating and checking AC/AD/AE/AF

Sprite multiplexor

16 sprites?
Because $98 contains 16 values all <= $0f (15)
al 98 .spriteIndexTable

$3802 is pulling items from the stack, from sp 0 upwards...
If negative, skipping the value...
If positive storing the index into the index table table and erplacing the value with $80 which is negative...
Unrolled for all index table entries!

The code above, is using a value divided by 2, hold on...
al b8 .spriteYPos
Because it was storing that into $d001
... sprite Y pos divided by 2...

Very familiar sort routine!

Basically the sort is identical to Armalyte...

Yup, same as Turbo Chrage as well. Same coder...
I guess Dan Phillips should have had a credit in Arnie too then :)


Game map graphics
Single buffered screen
No colour RAM updates?

charset $f800
Map W/H 256 128
At $4000 - $bfff
LRTB



Map collision fetch $1c71 using char mapped type table at $1ca6
f 1ca6 1da5 0


Title screen logo uses score panel charset at $f000
And the screen at $f400 overlaps this charset
And the title logo uses the empty space in the game map roughly middle left at 4,32
