BASIC Sprite multiplexing
https://youtu.be/Uo6p9TRzxec

I was looking at my old multiplexor and thought how it might be useful to expand its capabilities to include multicolour, priority, and expansion for each sprite.
The best way to use the multiplexor is to use the source code and assemble an optimised version that meets specific requirements: https://github.com/martinpiper/C64Public/tree/master/SpriteMultiplexor

Then I thought, why not add BASIC support for a pre-assembled version? So here it is: https://github.com/martinpiper/C64Public/blob/master/SpriteMultiplexor/BASICDemo.d64

The BASIC code is commented and demonstrates the functionality: https://github.com/martinpiper/C64Public/blob/master/SpriteMultiplexor/BASICDemo.txt
