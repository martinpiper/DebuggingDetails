$bed9 seems to be "say thing from X" where X = 1,2,3,4,5 ish , not 0
	$bf21 return
$bed8 = Say particular thing location
$880 = Say routine using A, which was X
	It seems to read one or more 4 byte table entries, with some command byte values
		@ $c2f and $cc0
		Command byte values test @$c2f  $ff $fe $fd
			Otherwise loads 4 bytes from table ROL ROL x4 from ind($cfe) = $e000
		@ $cc0 seems to trigger once per whole sentence, twice for the game intro
